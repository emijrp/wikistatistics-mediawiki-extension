This is an example extension. It doesn't really do anything on its own. It is
intended to provide a sample layout of a MediaWiki extension which a developer
can copy and use as a base for their own extension.

If you are checking this our from SVN and intend to copy it, please use:
	svn export /path/to/this/extension /path/to/new/extension
to create a clean copy without any extra SVN cruft.
